    what did I do yesterday? - nothing
    what will I do today? - revamp startscreen GUI into something more pleasant looking.
    is anything in my way? - yes, overlapping components is very difficult to achieve in swing. Either I learn all the ins and outs
    of all the layout managers, or I can learn how to override the paintComponent function in the awt and graphics2d libraries.

    what did I do yesterday? - replaced swing jbuttons with custom designed buttons that can detect mouse movement and change colors accordingly
