    what did I do yesterday? - nothing
    what will I do today? - revamp startscreen GUI into something more pleasant looking.
    is anything in my way? - yes, overlapping components is very difficult to achieve in swing. Either I learn all the ins and outs
    of all the layout managers, or I can learn how to override the paintComponent function in the awt and graphics2d libraries.
    
Thursday - 

    what did I do yesterday? - replaced swing jbuttons with custom designed buttons that can detect mouse movement and change colors accordingly
    what will I do today? - make the new buttons overlap with a background image of my choosing.
    is anything in my way? - the buttons are designed so that they align in the middle of the screen, but the background image
                            is rooted at 0,0. Hence any stretching of the frame will break alignment. Need to fix.
                            
Friday -

    what did I do yesterday? - did background stuff.
    what will I do today? - revamp the gameMode selection screen to be more similar to the starting screen.
    is anything in my way? - lots of the code will be similar to the start screen, gotta figure out a way of abstracting the logic so
                        I dont have to copy and paste large chunks of code to achieve the same effect.
